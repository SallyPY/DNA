DNA
===

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For my high school senior project, I chose computer science and biolgoy as focus topics. I ultimately decided on creating a video game based on DNA transcription as a way to merge these two fields. With only a few months of AP Computer Science, the starting point was tutorials.</p>

<p>I began following the BlockBunny tutorials of Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IV37n-uBpRp64hQIwywWQ">
ForeignGuyMike</a>, going off on my own when the differences between his game and my game became too great.</p>

<p> To create Decoding Life, I used the LibGDX application framework, which is specifically designed for game development. The graphics were created in either Gimp, a graphics editor, or  Blender, 3D graphics software.</p>

<h2>Background Info</h2>
<p>Decoding Life is a simple game that tests the user's knowledge of complementary base-pairings between DNA and mRNA. DNA cannot move out from the nucleus, so in order for the information it contains to reach the ribosomes (and be translated into enzymes), a transportable copy has to be created first. This is the mRNA. </p>

<p>DNA is made up of four bases: A, T, C, G. When mRNA is created in a process called transcription, there are required base-pairings. C must be matched with G. C must be matched with G.  A must be matched with T.  And the trick? U, not T, must be matched with A. </p>

<p>The user acts as the RNA polymerase, which travels down the DNA strand to make an mRNA copy. The game is played with a moving screen. A box in the corner shows one of the four bases. The user is given two options for a base pair and only a few seconds to decide. If the right base is chosen, the user gets a check, and if not, an X. Another base is shown and the process continues until the polymerase has reached the ending platform. </p>

<h2>Running the zip file with Eclipse</h2>
<div>
  <ol>
    <li>Download and unzip the file.</li>
    <li>In Eclipse, File->Import->General->Import Existing Projects Into Workspace. Browse for my file in the root directory section. You might have to change the JRE System Library to one compatible with mine. I used JavaSE 1.8.</li>
    <li>Do this by right-clicking the Escape folder, Properties ->Libraries</li>
    <li>Remove the current library by selecting it and clicking Remove Library. Add a compatible library.</li>
    <li>Right-click the DNA-desktop folder, Run As a Java Application </li>
  </ol>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>I posted this project some time after I last looked at at. After downloading and replaying my game, I'm seeing problems with the timing. I will come back to fix this. I also left no comments. I'll try to come back to remedy these things, but currently this project is not a top priority</p>
