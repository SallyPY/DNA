DNA
===

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>For my high school senior project, I chose computer science and biolgoy as focus topics. I ultimately decided on creating a video game based on DNA transcription as a way to merge these two fields. With only a few months of AP Computer Science, the starting point was tutorials.</p>

<p>I began following the BlockBunny tutorials of Youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_IV37n-uBpRp64hQIwywWQ">
ForeignGuyMike</a>, going off on my own when the differences between his game and my game became too great.</p>

<p> I used the LibGDX application framework, which is specifically designed for game development. The graphics were created in either Gimp, a graphics editor, or  Blender, 3D graphics software.</p>
